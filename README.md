# Virus-Attack

**Virus Attack** is a 2d pixel-style platformer where you take the role of a Virus infecting a new host. Your task is to carefully navigate the host's lungs, fight through hordes of cells that are trying to stop you and pop all the baloon-like Alveoli.

The events in this game are not anatomically accurate.

However, we wish to remind everyone to adhere to better hygiene and to prioritize health!

WE HIGHLY RECCOMEND YOU TRY THE DOWNLOAD VERSION!!
